Print at 100% infill with a layer height of 0.1mm with a base layer of 0.2mm


 The Model is 60x60mm in size

The model is 1.40mm thick.
The region from 1.20 to 1.40mm could have a Height Range Modifier to minimize print time.

This print uses 2 unique filaments

Swap Instructions:
	You do not set Layer Swaps in the slicer.  Instead each color slider is represented by an STL file.
	The file is named with the filament at the end so it's easy to assign them in the slicer.
	Load all of the STLs at once and your slicer will ask if it is a Multi-part model.  Select yes.
	Load up your filaments, then assign them in the Object view tab by clicking on the colored box
	and either pressing the number of the filament or clicking a second time and selecting from the dropdown.

FlatForge Printing Instructions:
	FlatForge prints REQUIRE automatic Filament Swapping.  There can be as many swaps per layer as you have sliders.
	If you have selected Double Sided or Face Down the model is already rotated face down
	and there is a transparent layer of your Base Layer thickness on the bottom.
	Since this is a full layer, you may pause at layer 2 and swap a spool of filament (or a tool) and continue.
	This is the only swap that will work.

NOTICE: You may notice some small gaps and minor errors in the split files.
This is a work in progress and I hope to have these resolved in future versions.
In the meantime, small numbers of errors do not affect the print results.
